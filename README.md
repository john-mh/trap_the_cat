# Trap the Cat 🐾

Welcome to Trap the Cat, a simple and strategic game implemented in Java with JavaFX for 2D modeling.

## Game Overview 🎮

Trap the Cat is a game where a cat moves across a grid-based board. Players aim to encircle the cat by choosing adjacent cells, preventing its escape.

The board features cells that are navigable by the cat. In turns, players select cells, rendering them impassable for the cat, gradually limiting the available space until it is captured.

## How to Play 🕹️

1. **Start the Game:** Run the Java application to launch the game board.

2. **Game Board:** The game board consists of a grid where the cat can move.

3. **Player Turns:** Players take turns to select the cell. Cats try to escape

4. **Game Outcome:** The game ends when the cat is trapped or escapes. Players can choose to play multiple rounds.

## Controls 🖱️

- Use mouse clicks to select cells.

## Implementation Details 🛠️

- **Graph Theory:** The game is implemented using graph algorithms, including Graph Traversals (BFS, DFS), Minimum Weight Paths (Dijkstra, Floyd-Warshall), and Minimum Spanning Tree (Prim, Kruskal).

- **Java and JavaFX:** The game is coded in Java, utilizing JavaFX for the 2D graphical interface.

## How to Run the Code ▶️

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/catch-the-cat.git

- Compile and run the Java code using your preferred IDE or the command line.
- Enjoy playing Catch the Cat!
